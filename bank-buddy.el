;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This package provides financial analysis and reporting capabilities
;; for bank statement data, it includes:
;;
;; - Transaction summaries and overviews
;; - Spending category analysis
;; - Top merchant identification
;; - Monthly spending patterns
;; - Recurring subscription detection
;;
;; The package reads CSV bank statement data *asynchronously*, categorizes
;; transactions, and generates detailed reports in Org-mode format.
;;
;;; Quick Start
;;
;;  (use-package bank-buddy)
;;
;;  1. Export your bank statement as a CSV file
;;  2. Edit CSV using csv-mode for all lines to DATE,DESCRIPTION,AMOUNT
;;  3. Open CSV file
;;  4. Run: =M-x bank-buddy-generate=
;;  5. Open the generated report
;;
