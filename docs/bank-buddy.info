1 Introduction
**************

Bank Buddy is an Emacs package that provides comprehensive financial
analysis and reporting capabilities for your bank statements.  It
processes CSV bank statement data, categorizes transactions using
customizable patterns, and generates detailed reports in Org-mode
format.

Key Features
============

   • *Asynchronous Processing:* Efficiently handles large bank
     statements without blocking Emacs
   • *Smart Transaction Categorization:* Auto-categorizes transactions
     based on customizable regex patterns
   • *Comprehensive Financial Reports:* Generates detailed reports in
     Org-mode with various analysis sections
   • *Interactive Category Management:* Edit and refine categorization
     patterns directly from reports
   • *Data Visualizations:* Generates charts and graphs using org-plot
   • *Subscription Detection:* Automatically identifies recurring
     payments and estimates monthly costs
   • *CSV-focused Analysis:* Designed specifically for bank statement
     CSV files

Why Bank Buddy?
===============

Bank Buddy was developed to solve specific pain points in analyzing
personal bank statements:

  1. *Automatic Categorization:* Most financial tools require manual
     categorization or complex rules for imports.  Bank Buddy learns and
     improves categorization over time.
  2. *Focus on Insights:* Unlike general accounting systems that focus
     on balancing books, Bank Buddy helps you discover spending patterns
     and optimize your finances.
  3. *Real Bank Statement Analysis:* Designed to work directly with
     actual bank statement CSV exports, not idealized financial data.
  4. *Low Maintenance:* No need to manually enter transactions or
     maintain a complex financial system - just periodically analyze
     your bank statements.
  5. *Emacs Native:* Built entirely within the Emacs ecosystem,
     leveraging Org-mode for rich, interactive reports.

File: bank-buddy.info,  Node: CSV Format,  Next: Report Generation,  Prev: Quick Start,  Up: Top

4 CSV Format
************

Bank Buddy expects CSV files with at least the following columns:
   • Transaction date
   • Transaction description
   • Debit amount

   Different banks format their CSV exports differently.  You may need
to preprocess your CSV to match this format.

   For optimal results, your CSV should include:

Date format
     YYYY-MM-DD format is preferred
Description
     The merchant name or transaction description
Amount
     Positive values for debits (money spent)

5 Report Generation
*******************

To generate a financial report:

     M-x bank-buddy-generate-report

   You'll be prompted to select an input CSV file and specify the output
Org file.

   The package processes the data asynchronously, so Emacs remains
responsive even with large CSV files.  When processing is complete,
you'll be asked if you want to open the generated report.

Command Options
===============

‘bank-buddy-generate-report’
     Generate a financial report from a CSV file

7 Transaction Categories
************************

Bank Buddy uses regular expression patterns to categorize transactions.
These are defined in the variable ‘bank-buddy-cat-list-defines’.

Default Categories
==================

Bank Buddy comes with predefined categories including:

Category Code   Description   Example Patterns

                              amazon
o               Other         .* (catch-all)

Category Format
===============

Categories are defined as patterns in the form:

     (REGEX-PATTERN CATEGORY-CODE)

   Where:
   • ‘REGEX-PATTERN’ is a regular expression that matches transaction
     descriptions
   • ‘CATEGORY-CODE’ is a short code representing the category (e.g.,
     "fod" for food)

   Example:
     ("amazon\\|amz" "amz")  ; Amazon purchases
     ("netflix\\|spotify\\|youtube" "str")  ; Streaming services

Customizing Categories
======================

You can customize the category patterns by setting
‘bank-buddy-cat-list-defines’:

     (customize-set-variable 'bank-buddy-cat-list-defines
       '(("amazon\\|amz" "amz")
         ("netflix\\|spotify" "str")
         ("uber\\|lyft" "txi")
         ("sainsburys\\|tesco\\|asda" "fod")
         ;; Add your own patterns here
         (".*" "o")))  ; Catch-all pattern should be last

Customizing Category Names
==========================

Category codes are mapped to human-readable names via
‘bank-buddy-category-names’:

     (customize-set-variable 'bank-buddy-category-names
       '(("amz" . "Amazon")
         ("str" . "Streaming Services")
         ("txi" . "Taxi & Rideshare")
         ("fod" . "Groceries")
         ;; Add your own mappings here
         ("o" . "Other")))


File: bank-buddy.info,  Node: Subscription Detection,  Next: Category Management,  Prev: Transaction Categories,  Up: Top

8 Subscription Detection
************************

Bank Buddy can automatically detect recurring payments like
subscriptions or regular bills.  This is especially useful for
identifying forgotten or unnecessary recurring charges.

How It Works
============

Bank Buddy looks for transactions that:

   • Appear multiple times (configurable via
     ‘bank-buddy-subscription-min-occurrences’)
   • Have the same or very similar amounts
   • Occur at regular intervals (weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, or
     annually)

Subscription Patterns
=====================

Define specific subscription patterns for better detection:

     (customize-set-variable 'bank-buddy-subscription-patterns
       '(("NETFLIX" . "Netflix")
         ("SPOTIFY" . "Spotify")
         ("AMAZON PRIME" . "Amazon Prime")
         ;; Add your own patterns here
         ))

Frequency Analysis
==================

Bank Buddy estimates the frequency of subscriptions:

‘Weekly’
     Transactions occurring approximately every 5-10 days
‘Bi-weekly’
     Transactions occurring approximately every 11-20 days
‘Monthly’
     Transactions occurring approximately every 25-35 days
‘Annual’
     Transactions occurring approximately every 350-380 days
‘Irregular’
     Transactions that occur multiple times but not at regular intervals

9 Category Management
*********************

Bank Buddy includes an interactive mode for managing transaction
categories: ‘bank-buddy-cat-mode’.

Enabling bank-buddy-cat-mode
============================

When viewing a Bank Buddy report, the mode is automatically enabled.
You can also enable it manually:

     M-x bank-buddy-cat-mode

Adding New Categories
=====================

To add a transaction to a category:

  1. Navigate to an unmatched transaction (in the "Unmatched
     Transactions" section)
  2. Press ‘C-c C-a’ (‘bank-buddy-cat-add-pattern’)
  3. Choose an existing category or create a new one
  4. Optionally save the updated category definitions to your init file
  5. Regenerate the report to see the changes

Regenerating Reports
====================

After modifying categories, regenerate the report:

     C-c C-r (bank-buddy-cat-regenerate-report)

Viewing Unmatched Transactions
==============================

To quickly view and manage unmatched transactions:

     M-x bank-buddy-view-unmatched-transactions

Saving Category Definitions
===========================

When adding a new category pattern, you'll be asked if you want to save
the updated definitions to your init file.

12 Comparison
*************

Bank Buddy can be compared to several other Emacs packages for financial
management.

Ledger-mode
===========

Ledger-mode is an Emacs interface to the command-line Ledger accounting
system.

   • Ledger is a complete double-entry accounting system; Bank Buddy is
     focused on bank statement analysis
   • Ledger requires manual transaction entry or carefully formatted
     imports; Bank Buddy automates categorization
   • Ledger offers more comprehensive accounting features; Bank Buddy
     focuses on spending insights
   • Bank Buddy provides visual spending breakdowns and charts

   *When to use Ledger:* For complete personal finance tracking,
investments, budgeting, and double-entry accounting.  *When to use Bank
Buddy:* For quick analysis of bank statements and visualizing spending
patterns.

Beancount-mode
==============

Beancount-mode is an Emacs mode for Beancount, another plain-text
accounting system.

   • Beancount, like Ledger, is a full double-entry accounting system
   • Beancount has stricter syntax requirements than Ledger
   • Bank Buddy offers automatic categorization and reporting
   • Beancount generates sophisticated reports, but requires more setup

   *When to use Beancount:* For precise, auditable personal accounting
with strict validation.  *When to use Bank Buddy:* For simple spending
analysis without learning accounting principles.

Money
=====

Money is a simple package for tracking expenses in Org-mode.

   • Money uses simple org-mode tables for basic expense tracking
   • Money is designed for manual entry of expenses
   • Bank Buddy focuses on automated analysis of bank-provided data
   • Bank Buddy provides more sophisticated visualization

   *When to use Money:* For simple manual expense tracking in Org.
*When to use Bank Buddy:* For analyzing historical bank data and
discovering spending patterns.

csv-mode and orgtbl-mode
========================

Some users analyze financial CSV data using built-in Emacs packages.

   • These are general-purpose tools requiring manual customization
   • Bank Buddy provides specialized, financial-specific analysis
   • Bank Buddy automatically categorizes transactions
   • Bank Buddy generates comprehensive reports automatically

   *When to use csv/orgtbl-mode:* For custom, one-off analysis of
financial data.  *When to use Bank Buddy:* For consistent, repeatable
analysis of bank statements.

13 Troubleshooting
******************

CSV Parsing Issues
==================

If your bank's CSV format is not recognized:

   • Check that your CSV has columns for date, description, and debit
     amount
   • Pre-process the CSV if necessary to match the expected format
   • Check for encoding issues if you see garbled text in reports

Performance Considerations
==========================

Bank Buddy processes CSV files asynchronously to avoid blocking Emacs.
However, with very large files:

   • Initial parsing may take longer
   • Generated reports might be large
   • Consider filtering or pre-processing very large CSV files

Common Issues
=============

Unmatched Transactions
     Review and add patterns for your common merchants using the
     category management mode
Duplicate Categories
     Check for overlapping regex patterns in your category definitions
Date Format Issues
     Ensure dates are in YYYY-MM-DD format for best results
Category Mistakes
     If transactions are being assigned to the wrong categories, review
     your regex patterns, particularly those that might be too broad
